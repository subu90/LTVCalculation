TopXSimpleLTVCustomers(top_n, dataset):

Gets the n and the ingested data set as inputs
processes the stream data and stores the data in the following data structures

customer_weekly_metrics - A dictionary of aggregated metrics (store_visits, orders, order_amount,spend_per_visit)
                            partitioned at customer , year and week 
unique_customers - stores the unique set of customers
ltv_per_customer -  A dictionary of aggregated metrics (total_store_visits, total_orders, total_order_amount,
                                                        total_weeks, ltv) per each customer
Assumptions :                                                        
1) Min and max week are calculated within the available date range to get the LTV for that range
    eg : If we have two years of incomplete data the ranges for those years are calculated within 
    {2017: {'min_week': 1, 'max_week': 13}, 2018: {'min_week': 13, 'max_week': 13}}
    Notice the total weeks are calculated as 14 ( 13 in 2017 and 1 in 2018)
    [('96f55c7d8f42', {'total_store_visits': 6, 'total_orders': 6, 'total_order_amount': 78.04, 'total_weeks': 14, 'ltv': 2898.6285714285714}),
     ('96f55c7d8f44', {'total_store_visits': 5, 'total_orders': 5, 'total_order_amount': 71.7, 'total_weeks': 14, 'ltv': 2663.1428571428573})]
     
     In the real world this will not be an issue because the data will be continuous 

                                                        
2) Weeks with no events for the customer are assigned 0 for the respective metrics 
    eg: User with one order on week 13 will have ltv calculated for that whole range



Performance boosts :

1) lTV is being updated per each customer on the fly using weighted average while calculating 
aggregates at the customer level which saves another whole iteration of the customer data just for calculating LTV.
2) Top N is calculated on aggregated data sorted using heap which is better in performance the sorting the 
entire customer events in case of multi-millions events
